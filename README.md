TaidoMatchup
============

Development repository for taido matchup and realtime results

Will consist of a DB that will contain all the participants as well as the current drawing for matches. 
The same DB will contain the results of said match-up for real-time viewing at the presentation side. 

Presentation view: HTML page (due to simplicity?) that will be shown on a larger screen on the side. 
Local or remote access? Will show the next coming two matches as well as the latest results of all matches. 

Administrative side: Able to see the coming matches for shout out to the attendants. See the results of the latest 
matches. Should be able to see the whole pool system. Windows form based due to simplicity?
